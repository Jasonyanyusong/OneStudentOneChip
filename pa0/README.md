This is the working directory of PA0. In PA0, we are required to install a copy of Linux (specially Ubuntu Linux 22.04.1 LTS, but other distributions of Linux are also supported)

In this experiment, I have successfully finished the installation of Linux and related tools. The list of tools are 1) build-essential 2) libreadline-dev 3)libsdl2-dev 4)llvm 5)llvm-dev 6)git 7)vim 8)gdb 9) gtkwave

Also, I extended and created installation scripts for Ubuntu, Kali, Debian, Fedora and macOS. For macOS, both x86_64 and arm64 can be installed by this script.

In the shell files above, the computer will download icarus-verilog and verilator from GitHub, the version of icarus-verilog is v12.0 and the verison of verilator is v4.210.

For more tools (for example: openssh-server, htop and others can also be installed easily)
