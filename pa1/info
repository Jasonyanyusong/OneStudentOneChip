PA1 is about using environments setting and using.

ISA Selection: For ysyx2204, we are required to select RISCV64IM.

In this PA, I will:
	1)compile and fix bugs and make refinements (the exit function) of NEMU

Update: The old nemu faces env crashes, so I built a new folder to store new nemu, called "nemu_new"
